Specification: Libraries and Technologies Used

1. Node.js:
   - Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows executing JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It provides a server-side environment for running JavaScript applications.

2. Gmail API:
   - The Gmail API is a Google API that allows developers to interact with Gmail services programmatically. It provides methods to read, send, and manage emails, threads, labels, and other Gmail-related functionalities.

3. googleapis NPM Package:
   - The googleapis package is an official Google client library for Node.js that provides easy access to various Google APIs, including the Gmail API. It simplifies the authentication process and provides convenient methods for making API requests.

4. OAuth 2.0:
   - OAuth 2.0 is an open authorization protocol that allows applications to access user data from third-party services without exposing the user's credentials. It is used for authenticating and authorizing access to the Gmail API.

5. dotenv NPM Package:
   - The dotenv package is a module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into the `process.env` object in Node.js. It allows storing sensitive information, such as API keys or access tokens, outside of the codebase.

6. JavaScript:
   - JavaScript is a widely-used programming language for building web applications. It is the primary language used for developing the server-side logic of the Gmail bot application.


7. Git and GitHub:
    - Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes to their codebase. GitHub is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. They are commonly used for version control, collaboration, and deployment of the application code.

These are the key libraries and technologies used in the development of a Gmail bot application. The specific implementation and usage may vary depending on the requirements and architecture of your application.
